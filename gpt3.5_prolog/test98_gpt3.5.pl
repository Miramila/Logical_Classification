% Define that there are two groups with equal number of patients
group(w_group).
group(placebo_group).
% Define that all patients are suffering from refractory disease T and have taken conventional drugs
suffering_from(T, patient).
taken_conventional_drugs(patient).
% Divide patients into two groups
divided_into_groups(Group1, Group2) :- group(Group1), group(Group2), Group1 \= Group2.
% Experimental drug used to treat T
experimental_drug(w).
% Define deaths occurred in both groups
deaths_occurred_in(Group, number) :- group(Group), number is 44.
% Weakening statement: Among the patients who died, the average life span of the second group was two years shorter than that of the first group
average_lifespan_decrease(Group1, Group2) :- deaths_occurred_in(Group1, _), deaths_occurred_in(Group2, _), Group1 \= Group2.
% Check if the weakening statement weakens the argument
weaken_argument :- average_lifespan_decrease(w_group, placebo_group).
