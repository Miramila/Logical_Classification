Based on given description here is your prolog code.
% Define that there is an average loss of weight for certain groups
averageLoss(group, 9).
averageLoss(middle_aged, 13).
averageLoss(youth, 7).
% Define that initial weight of middle-aged group was more than youth group
heavierBeforeLoss(middle_aged_group, young_group).
% Define conclusion that participants in young group weighed less than those in middle-aged group before losing weight
lighterBeforeLoss(X, Y) :- heavierBeforeLoss(Y, X).
% Facts (assuming a fact which aligns with the conclusion)
heavierBeforeLoss(middle_aged_group, young_group).
?- lighterBeforeLoss(young_group, middle_aged_group).
Above prolog code defines the average loss of weight for whole group, middle-aged group and youth group. Then it defines predicate `heavierBeforeLoss(X, Y)` indicating group X was heavier than group Y before weight loss. Based on this, another predicate `lighterBeforeLoss(X, Y)` is defined indicating group X was lighter than group Y before weight loss.
