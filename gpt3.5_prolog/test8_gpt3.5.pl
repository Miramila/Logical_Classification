% First we define the notion of creation
created(god, earth, first_day).
created(god, moon, second_day).
created(god, sun, third_day).
% Then we define the equivalent of a day for god and us
same_day_meaning(god, humans).
% Now we check if there is any evidence to support the following assertion: 
% "Regarding the meaning of 'one day', God has the same understanding and use with us"
?- \+ same_day_meaning(god, humans).
% Define the fact that at least one individual from Cantonese dislikes chili
cantonese(X) :- dislike_chili(X). 
% If a person is Cantonese and dislikes chili, then this person is also considered as a Southerner who dislikes chili
southerner(X) :- cantonese(X), dislike_chili(X). 
% Define the fact that some Cantonese like neither chilis nor sweets
cantonesewho_likes_neither_chili_nor_sweet(X) :- cantonese(X), \+ likes_chilis(X), \+ likes_sweet(X). 
% Define individual characteristics (Assuming 'cantonese1' fulfills the specifications)
dislike_chili(cantonese1).
\+ likes_chilis(cantonese1).
\+ likes_sweet(cantonese1).
% Finally we can query to check the correctness of the statement
