The main reason is the wind..Engineer William Lemaisault pointed out that when people on the ground felt the breeze blowing, the 500m height was actually a raging wind.In 1978, the 278.9-meter-high Citigroup Center building just erected in New York, which is from Lemai The hand of Sur.An architecture student asked him a question: Is the building so high that it is possible to be blown down by the wind? Lemaisur burst into a cold sweat and suddenly realized that he only considered the design.The vertical wind direction and the influence of the 45-degree wind direction were left behind!
