"Iron is an essential nutrient for all organisms, and marine phytoplankton must extract iron from seawater.Iron produced in seawater is usually very small, so for the vast ocean area, the limitation of iron limits the growth of phytoplankton Iron in seawater mainly comes from aerosols in rivers.However, most of these iron-containing aerosols are deposited in offshore areas, so the transportation of wind and dust has become the main form of iron supply in oceans far from the continent, especially for less iron.In areas such as high latitudes, this replenishment can greatly promote the growth of phytoplankton.",C.Iron-bearing materials transported by wind and dust are important to marine phytoplankton,1
